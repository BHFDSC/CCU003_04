# Indirect effects of the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic on secondary care for cardiovascular disease in the UK: an electronic health record analysis across three nations

## Project description

Coronavirus (COVID-19) causes direct morbidity and mortality, and indirect impact on non-COVID services, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), which has been disproportionately affected, yet lacking coordinated policy responses. We analysed hospital-based activity before and during the pandemic, across major CVD subtypes in England, Scotland and Wales.
